# GRIST, the Grid Boost Scheduler for Home Assistant

**GRIST** helps Home Assistant users minimize grid electricity costs by intelligently managing battery charging and solar usage in homes equipped with solar panels and battery storage. It is designed for systems where the battery can supply most or all of the home's daily electricity needs. The scheduler automatically determines how much to charge the battery during off-peak hours, aiming to avoid grid usage during expensive peak times. It adapts to changing weather and load conditions using solar forecasts and historical consumption data, and provides manual override options for special circumstances.

## Features

- **Automatic Grid Boost Calculation:**
  Calculates the required battery charge (SoC) for off-peak charging based on solar forecasts, historical load, and PV performance.
- **Manual Override:**
  Allows users to manually set the grid boost SoC target.
- **PV Forecast Integration:**
  Fetches and automatically adjusts solar production forecasts based on actual PV performance.
- **Historical Data Integration:**
  Tracks and averages load and PV production using Home Assistant sensors in order to optimize calculations as seasonal changes occur or system changes are introduced.
- **Battery and PV Monitoring:**
  Self-adjusts to the addition or removal of battery and PV capacity.
- **Custom Sensors:**
  Exposes calculated values and statistics as Home Assistant sensor entities so you can display key information on your dashboards.
- **Configurable Options:**
  All key options (modes, SoC targets, update hour, history days, minimum SoC) are configurable via the UI.
- **Extensible Forecast Support:**
  Supports multiple forecast providers:[Solcast]([https://solcast.com](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar), [Forecast.solar](https://forecast.solar/),and [Meteo](https://github.com/rany2/ha-open-meteo-solar-forecast).
- **Multiple modes:**
- Supports the following modes: Automatic, Manual, Testing, Off. Automatic mode manages grid boost daily. Manual mode allows you to set a specific boost amount, which could be helpful for days when you know your usage will signficantly differ from your normal patterns of use (or when you know your panels will be covered with snow and produce little power even though the forecast expects sun). Testing mode allows you to watch what the system will do, but will not actually change the Time of Use settings of your inverter. Off, which is the same as testing.
- **Low overhead:**
- The system is designed to minimize the use of system resources.

## How It Works

### Data Collection and Forecasting

- **Solar Forecasts:**
  The integration fetches hourly solar production forecasts from supported APIs. These are updated twice daily; just past midnight local time, and at a configurable hour (default: 22:00 local time).

- **PV History:**
  The component tracks a rollling 21 day history of PV forecasts to compare forecasts to actual performance. This allows for more precise automatic adjustments of forecasts specific to your system, local shading, etc.

### Calculations

- **Required Boost Calculation:**
  Each day, the scheduler compares the adjusted solar forecast for tomorrow with the average load for each hour. It calculates the net deficit (when load exceeds PV) and determines the required battery boost percentage to cover expected shortfalls. This minimum requirement is added to a "buffer" the user sets so that there is always some reserve for those days when extra consumption occurs. This minimum buffer value is clamped between 5% and 99%.

- **Automatic PV Forecast Adjustment:**
  The forecasted PV for tomorrow is adjusted using the ratio of actual to forecast PV from the past 21 days, improving accuracy. This is important if you have shaded conditions during parts of the day, or if you have (for example) some panels facing east and some facing west. Most free teir forecasts do not allow you to specify multiple panel arrays, but the ratio is an elegent solution to account for this situation.

### Sensors Exposed

- **Estimated PV Power:**
  Current estimated PV power output as adjusted based on your system performance.

- **Calculated Grid Boost SoC:**
  Automatically calculated battery charge target for off-peak charging.

- **Actual Grid Boost SoC:**
  Actual grid boost setting applied to the inverter. (If you are

- **Manual Grid Boost SoC:**
  Manually set battery charge target, if override is active.

- **Battery Time Remaining:**
  Estimated hours of battery power remaining at current load.

- **Scheduler Entity:**
  Summarizes the current mode (automatic/manual), boost settings, load history days, and forecast values.

- **Load Entity:**
  Presents the average hourly load over the selected history period.

- **Shading Entity:**
  Shows the calculated shading ratio for each hour, based on PV performance.

- **Battery Life Entity:**
  Estimates the State of Charge for the battery for each hour, based on hourly estimated PV and load averages.

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. **Install the Integration:**
   Copy the `grist` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory. HACS installation will be added in a future release.

2. **Add via Home Assistant UI:**
   Go to *Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration* and search for "Grid Boost". Install the Grid Boost integration.

3. **Configure Options:**
   Set your preferred boost mode, manual SoC, grid boost start time, update hour, history days, and minimum SoC via the integration options panel.

### Options

- **Boost Mode:**
  Select between automatic, manual, off, or testing.
- **Manual Grid Boost (%):**
  Set the manual grid boost value as a percentage. This is used only when in Manual mode.
- **Grid Boost Start Time:**
  Set the time to start grid boost (e.g., 00:02 - two minutes past midnight).
- **Update Hour:**
  Set the hour of the day to run the calculations and update the inverter Time of Use setting (0-23, I suggest hour 22 which is 10pm local time).
- **Days of Load History:**
  Number of days of load history to use for calculations. I suggest 4 days, but when weather is changing you may want to set this shorter.
- **Minimum State of Charge (%):**
  Set the minimum battery SoC value. This is the buffer so your battery does not run down to 0% state of charge. I recommend at least 15%.

## Development Notes

- **Python 3.13+** is required.
- **Solar Assistant** is required. (Solar Assistant provides sensor data for actual PV data as well as manages Time of Use settings for the inverter.)
- **Sol-Ark Inverter**. This has only been tested with a Sol-Ark 12K2P inverter. While it would not be hard to modify for other inverters, the current version is only tested with a single Sol-Ark 12K2P inverter.
- Code is formatted with Ruff and linted with PyLint/MyPy.
- All I/O is async; no blocking calls.
- Follows Home Assistant's update coordinator and config flow patterns.
- Constants are centralized in `const.py` for maintainability.
- All sensors use unique IDs for state persistence. These are also maintained via const.py.
